# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 3: A/B Testing  

## Overview

This is the third project from the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The project explores concepts such as probability, A/B Testing, and Regression, and how to perform these analyses using SciPy and NumPy to draw conclusions regarding a company's test webpage.

This project was developed in 2020 during the Nanodegree and it is no longer maintained. 

## About
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of the A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  This goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Tech Stack
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Random
SciPy

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

### Datasets
[ab_data.csv](./ab_data.csv) - raw data set of e-commerce website A/B tests results

### Code
[Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook](./Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb) - main Jupyter Notebook containing the python code for this project
